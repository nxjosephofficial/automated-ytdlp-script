![Usage](https://github.com/nxjosephofficial/nxjosephofficial/blob/main/yt-dlp.gif)

That script needs yt-dlp. If you don't have yt-dlp, you can run yt-dlp-installer or install manually.
If you have yt-dlp, you can run downloader.
### Needed packages: curl ffmpeg
for Debian-based distros
```
sudo apt install curl ffmpeg
```
for Arch-based distros
```
sudo pacman -S curl ffmpeg
```
You can run put-to-bin for be able to execute downloader script from everywhere and rename downloader.
### Where are downloaded files?
for mp3 files, script puts them into ~/Music folder.
for mp4 and webm files, script puts them into ~/Videos folder.
