An automated yt-dlp shell script.

![Usage](https://github.com/nxjosephofficial/nxjosephofficial/blob/main/yt-dlp.gif)

## We need curl and ffmpeg
If you are using apt package manager or debian-based distro, run the code below: 
```
sudo apt install curl ffmpeg 
```
If you are using pacman package manager or arch-based distro, run the code below:
```
sudo pacman -S curl ffmpeg
```
If you aren't using these package managers:
Sorry, i don't know other package managers and you can search it on the net like "how to install curl with 'your package manager'" or "how to install curl in 'your distro'".
## You have to give execution permissions to run these scripts.
Go to "bin" folder and run the code below:
```
chmod a+rx *
```
Go to "yt-dlp" folder and run the code below:
```
chmod a+rx *
```
## The "yt-dlp" folder is needed for installing yt-dlp, if you already installed you can skip it.

To install yt-dlp go to "yt-dlp" folder and run the code below:

for English script:
```
./yt-dlp_downloader
```
for Turkish script:
```
./yt-dlp_indirici
```

After installing yt-dlp, you have to go to "bin" folder and run script with bash terminal.
These scripts are available for 2 languages: English and Turkish.

for English script:
```
./downloader
```
for Turkish script:
```
./indirici
```

 ## Enjoy!

### If you want to run downloader script with any name you want and everywhere, take a look to optional folder.
